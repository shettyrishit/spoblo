                    <h3>Rohit Sharma</h3>

                    <h4>Co-founder</h4>

                    <p>When at the crease, Rohit is a sight for the gods. Strong and supple, resilient and elegant, he is as much a glider of the ball as he is a bludgeoner. For someone who started off as an off-spinner, Rohit has literally slogged his way to the top of the order. The only batsmen with two double centuries in ODI cricket, his batting is a blend of artistry and attack. One of the first names on the team sheet across formats, he has mastered the method of compiling ‘Daddy Hundreds’. And, with three IPL titles in the kitty, two of those as skipper of Mumbai Indians skipper, it’s but obvious that his popularity is sky-high. Hublot, the luxury watchmaker, is one of the many top brands he has endorsed.</p>

                    <h3>Abhishek Nayar</h3>

                    <h4>Co-founder and head of strategy</h4>

                    <p>An all-rounder in every sense of the word, Abhishek exemplifies Mumbai’s famed cricket culture. With nearly 5,000 runs and more than 100 wickets at the first-class level, he was the fulcrum of multiple Ranji Trophy-winning squads. With three ODI caps to his name, Abhishek became a household name through his exploits for Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the IPL. A fitness freak, he is the go-to man for teammates and opponents alike. He has developed a reputation of mentoring both established and upcoming sportspersons. He is the only active player who runs a sports academy. Needless to say, Abhishek drives SPOBLO’s strategy.</p>
